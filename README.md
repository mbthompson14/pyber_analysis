# pyber_analysis

## Overview
This project analyzed ride-sharing data from PyBer to (1) generate a summary table of the ride-sharing data by city type and (2) visualize the total weekly fares in the spring of 2019 by city type.

## Results
The analysis revealed that the total number of rides, drivers and fares was highest for urban cities, followed by suburban and lastly rural. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver showed the reverse trend.

The total fares by city type remained fairly stable for January, February, March, and April of 2019.

## Summary
I speculate that the differences in city type are due to the population and infrastructure density of the respective cities. There are more rides in urban cities due to large populations, but the rides are shorter and less expensive due to urban density. By contrast, rural cities have smaller populations and fewer rides, but the length of the rides are necessarily longer as there is less density. Because these trends are expected and not problematic I do not propose any recommendations for addressing disparities among city types.
